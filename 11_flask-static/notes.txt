K11 -- Some Things Never Change
2021-10-06

First, we looked at app.py, which was very similar to the previous
times we looked at it. Then, we opened the static folder and saw foo
and foo.html.

We predicted that when you just run app.py at localhost, you would 
just see the same thing as usual ("no hablo queso"). But, when
we went to the static/foo.html path, we predicted that we would see
the uncommented html code. We were not quite sure what would happen
when we went to foo- our best guess was that it just loaded as an
html file.

__RAN WEBSITE__

Once we ran the website, we observed that our predictions for app.py
and foo.html were correct, but static/foo downloaded the txt file, foo
onto our machine. 

Then, we created fixie.html, strongly based on foo.html. We also 
changed the font using the style tab to learn more!
