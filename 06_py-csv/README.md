### The Nice Mice: Noakai Aronesty, Ryan Wang, Eliza Knapp

We opened the file and we read it into a dictReader (an iterable object that contains a dictionary of each line).

We then iterated through each line (each dictionary), separated the two values into two lists (`job_class`, `percentage`) and removed the last dictionary ("Total: 99.8").

Finally, we used `random.choices()`, which takes two lists: the values to choose from (`job_class`) and the corresponding probability of selection (`percentage`). 

`k=1` means we are only selecting once. 

This implements the weighted randomized selection.
