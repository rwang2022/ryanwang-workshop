K12 -- ...or The Only Constant is Change?
2021-10-07

First, we looked at and ran app.py. We noticed that in addition to the 
usual no hablo queso function, there was also a return template function.
We saw that there was a template folder and the function in app.py
refered to the html file inside the template folder. We wondered how it 
knows without a path that model_tmplt exists. We assumed that it was the 
same as the static folder where it is known that it exists. To show this,
we changed the name of the templates folder to hello. It no longer worked.
We got an error- template not found error, because it couldn't find the 
template file.

Next, we observed more closely the code that was at the route /my_foist_template.
We saw that the first argument calls the template, and the rest are variables 
that can be accessed from the template file (model_tmplt.html) by delimiting
the variables in {{ variable name }}. We explored further by adding a new 
variable, which we called wombat in honor of our team name, and setting it 
equal to the value "hello". When we put wombat in curly braces, the value
that it was set to rendered on the page (the top now says hello in big letters).

We wondered, does it replace all instances of the variable wombat and predicted
that it did. Update: it does!

Answers to questions:
Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
You get a name error at /my_foist_template, but not at the root

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this  page?
Yes. It is http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template.

Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
First is the file in the templates folder, then are variables used in that file.
